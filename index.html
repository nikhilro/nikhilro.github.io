        <h1>Visions of Future: 2035</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Personal Robotics</h2>
        <p>Anya. She's our 3 year old angel.</p>
        
        <p>When she was born, Ila and I were frightened. She was such a little thing, all in our care.</p>
        
        <p>First thing to go was our sleep. I knew that babies are hard but fuck had never known sleep deprivation like this. They came out with v1 of Rumi back then, the caretaker nanny. It was around $250k with $1000 monthly subscription for maintenance.</p>
        
        <p>We could afford it but I didn't trust it. The founder Jeff is a friend and I did know the care behind it. They trained it for 3 years before launch. Rumi knows how to hold babies, how to change diapers, how to feed, and how to make babies laugh. It even has heating pad in it's chest so the baby can feel comfortable when being held. My grandma took care of me when I was little; I got grandma vibe from Rumi. I was just a little scared to not bond as deeply with Anya with Rumi around.</p>
        
        <p>Jeff has sold 100 million Rumi's since then. Parents stories are unanimous; kids love Rumi and kids love their parents! We discovered something new about human connection. It's intuitive since birth. Kids understood Rumi could take care of their physiological needs but her connection felt different. As their human minds developed, it needed other human souls piercing back at them to feel ok.</p>
        
        <p>The science on this was initially perplexing but settled now. To start, we, humans and AIs, are both blobs of neural circuitry with weights flowing and adapting as we go through life. Why haven't AI minds just converged to human minds? We know now our bodies feed us data that AIs just don't have. It's easiest to understand with cooking. AIs are great at making existing recipes but every weekend I go to Ross's for breakfast. Ross is tuned to the world, seasons, food, himself and others in a way that's ineffable. His new recipes touch my soul ("gut") in a way that only means something to another human. AI misses this <i>body's vote</i> in everything new it does, making <i>human taste</i> indispensable to every service.</p>
        
        <p>All this to say we're getting our Rumi! We're expecting our second and I would rather not lose myself to sleep deprivation again.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Personal Assistants</h2>
        <p>My morning coffee prep routine is a accompanied with a conversation with my favourite assistant Glow. We catch up on my emails, what I need to respond to, and what I can archive. Day's off to a great start.</p>
        
        <p>I shift soon to my morning workout. It's a sunny day, I love workouts on sunny days. Between the burn of reps, an idea strikes- what if we could help SunLife upsell their new conversational securities platform in insurance renewals. Do a quick bout with Glow on viability and ROI of the use case. We arrive at specificially targeting GenX demographic to start since they are the most eager for conversational experiences. Tell it to send an email to Chris asking for 5.</p>
        
        <p>Oh btw- Glow's been in my ear the entire time. At first, it was just AirPods but since <i>io 5</i> phones have kinda died out. The new holographic projection experience smoothly integrates visuals while you're on the go. Nowadays, everyone has a personal AI assistant. Most Americans use Glow. It's got a warm personality and feels honest but Chatty is also quite popular. Most countries have their own assistants, China has Yùyè.</p>
        
        <p>The clock's turning closer to 9:30, the rush begins to head to office. Tell Glow to call me an Waymo to the office as I put on my shoes and start heading down.</p>
        
        <p>Catching up on Stratectery in Waymo, he's short Nvidia wtf. I ask Glow to tell Roody (my Robinhood AI concierge) to send hourly updates on Nvidia and if there's serious down activity to talk with Glow to figure out next steps. Roody knows markets a little better while Glow knows me a little better. Glow will know when to esclate to me. They got this, not worth my cycles.</p>
        
        <p>Okay we're here at the office, 150 Spear. Damn bro, the view of Bay Bridge always gets me.</p>
        
        <p>The day is the usual whirlwind of reviewing work of agents and humans, spending time with customers (fav) and hiring. Oh ya, we still hire people. Companies these days are mostly "AI architects" and "Relationship managers". While most B2C communication at this point is AI concierges, the high-stakes B2B is left to "Relationship managers". You kinda need it because the spark of ideas that happen in human relationships serves humans in a way that just doesn't quite click in human AI relationships. This is also why "AI architects" still review B2C interactions happening with the AI concierge systems. The ineffable <i>human taste</i> to know how the company's AI concierge can serve it's customers better in an ever evolving world of needs.</p>
        
        <p>Glow reminds it's 7pm and it's called Waymo downstairs. Fuck. The days still feel too short. All this help from AI hasn't meant one bit for our desire to do more. Anyways, there's no point arguing with Glow. It's right I gotta get back to Ila and Anya.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Personal Health</h2>
        <p>America is healthier now. I notice it every weekend. The park near our place is busier, not just with kids but with parents chasing them. I see more strollers, more bikes, more soccer balls, more frisbees and way fewer people just sitting around on picnic blankets. The whole park feels like a giant playground. It's been so fun!</p>
        
        <p>GLP v3 is why. I remember when v1 came out (Ozempic). The results were real. But, we didn't know if the effects would hold over time or what hidden risks might show up years later. It proved the science, but it was just getting started.</p>
        
        <p>AI sped it up. Instead of years of trial and error, labs now simulate how new peptides would actually bind to GLP-1 receptors in our cells. They spin up thousands of versions on a computer, pick the ones that looked strongest without nasty side effects, and only move those into real trials.</p>
        
        <p>With v3, you just feel steadily energetic. Not superhuman like cocaine. More of a feels nice to not crash in the afternoons and have complete presence with Anya in the evenings.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, my parents told me they wanna do Machu Picchu for our holidays trip. A week in Peru, the altitude, the stairs, the long days on your feet. Wtf, can't believe they would suggest this. I'm starting to see it though. Not a miracle anti-aging drug, but a steady sense of feeling healthy and energetic.</p>
        
        <p>It's been heartening. The hardest part of obesity wasn't the numbers or the charts. It was the stuff people missed. Parents too tired to chase their kids. Grandparents stuck on benches instead of laughing on the field. Families living smaller lives than they wanted. Half the country carried that weight, and it showed up in every park, every living room.</p>
        
        <p>That's why v3 feels so different. It didn't turn us into athletes or make us immortal. It just lifted enough of the burden so people could get back to living. For me that means no afternoon crash and energy for Anya. For my parents it means Machu Picchu. For America it means parks that look like playgrounds again. Long live metabolic health, long live America.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Work & Community</h2>
        <p>Work is weird now. Pretty much every job collapsed into two roles: AI architects and relationship managers. That's it. Architects babysit fleets of agents, tweak prompts, and patch edge cases. Relationship managers spend their time with people, keeping trust alive and ideas flowing. Titles still exist like Marketing, Nurse, etc., but I'm talking about the essence of work. Everything else got eaten by AI years ago.</p>
        
        <p>The transition was scary. At first, AI ate coding and eventually every "real" skill I had. All that was left to do was to <i>feel</i>... But what do you do with all these feelings? We all had to figure out how to serve each other again.</p>
        
        <p>For me, I built taste in building AI concierges. I can tune into a group of executives to understand what they want from their AI concierge. You could say I'm trying to earn their <i>body's vote</i> that the concierge <i>feels</i> right. I had to do this before, but now it's all I do.</p>
        
        <p>One unexpected change, my neighborhood feels closer. We actually get together now, communal gatherings are back in fashion. Conversations aren't about catching up on "what's new at work" but actually laughing about life.</p>
        
        <p>It happened because work pushed us here. When AI took the transactional work, the only thing left was <i>taste</i> and <i>presence</i>. You had to actually pay attention to people, to how they felt, to whether something landed. And once we got sharper at that for work, it bled into the rest of life. We didn't just get better at reading humans, we got more interested in each other again.</p>
        
        <p>It's ironic. AI ate the work, and somehow it gave us back community.</p>
